# 1. Introduction

The AMMWithdraw transaction allows liquidity providers to redeem their LP tokens for underlying pool assets. This document provides technical implementation details for the withdrawal logic in `rippled`.

The [AMM documentation](README.md#33-ammwithdraw-transaction) describes the high-level business logic of withdrawals, including different [withdrawal modes](README.md#331-withdrawal-modes), their purposes, and user-facing behavior. This document focuses on the implementation: how the code validates constraints, calculates withdrawal amounts, and executes asset transfers.

**Terminology Notes**:

Throughout the document we refer to equations by their number in the [XLS-30 specification](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0030-automated-market-maker).
AMM helpers use **token** as a subject in many function names. This refers to any supported currency in the system, not only a particular token implementation, like trust lines or MPTs.

# 2. applyGuts

The `applyGuts` function[^applyGuts] is the main entry point for processing AMMWithdraw transactions. It retrieves the AMM ledger entry and the withdrawer's LP token balance, determines how many LP tokens to redeem (all tokens for `tfWithdrawAll`/`tfOneAssetWithdrawAll`, or the specified amount from `LPTokenIn`), then adjusts the LP token balance for precision if needed. The function gets the current pool balances and determines which trading fee applies to the withdrawer (regular or discounted for [auction slot holders](#3-gettradingfee)). Based on the transaction flags and provided fields, it dispatches to one of five withdrawal mode handlers (implementing seven total modes): two [multi-asset modes](#4-multi-asset-withdrawal-modes) that maintain proportional withdrawals, and three [single-asset modes](#5-single-asset-withdrawal-modes) that perform single-sided withdrawals. Each mode handler calculates the withdrawal amounts and LP tokens to burn, then calls the [common withdraw function](#6-common-withdraw-function) to execute the actual asset transfers and update the pool state. After the withdrawal, if the pool is empty (zero LP tokens), the function attempts to delete the AMM account - if successful, the AMM is fully removed; if incomplete due to remaining trust lines, the AMM remains in an empty state with the LP token balance set to zero.

# 3. getTradingFee

Determines the trading fee for the withdrawer, accounting for auction slot discounts. Same implementation as AMMDeposit, see [deposit.md](deposit.md#3-gettradingfee).

# 4. Multi-Asset Withdrawal Modes

Multi-asset withdrawal modes maintain proportional withdrawals by removing both pool assets simultaneously. This preserves the pool's price (asset ratio) while decreasing liquidity. Since these withdrawals maintain proportional ratios, they incur no trading fees.

The modes are:
- **[equalWithdrawTokens](#41-equalwithdrawtokens-tflptoken-tfwithdrawall) (tfLPToken, tfWithdrawAll)** - Redeem exact LP tokens or all LP tokens, receive proportional amounts of both assets
- **[equalWithdrawLimit](#42-equalwithdrawlimit-tftwoasset) (tfTwoAsset)** - Specify maximum amounts for both assets, system calculates LP tokens to burn

## 4.1. equalWithdrawTokens (tfLPToken, tfWithdrawAll)

> "I want to redeem exactly X LP tokens, how much of both assets do I get?" (tfLPToken)
> "Redeem all my LP tokens for both assets." (tfWithdrawAll)

Proportional withdrawal of pool assets for the amount of LP tokens.[^equalWithdrawTokens]

[^equalWithdrawTokens]: AMMWithdraw::equalWithdrawTokens: [AMMWithdraw.cpp](https://github.com/gregtatcam/rippled/blob/a72c3438eb0591a76ac829305fcbcd0ed3b8c325/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/AMMWithdraw.cpp#L804-L887)

This function handles two related modes. With `tfLPToken`, the user specifies the exact number of LP tokens to redeem using `LPTokenIn`, and the function calculates the proportional amounts of both assets to withdraw. With `tfWithdrawAll`, the user redeems their entire LP token balance without specifying an amount. The function handles a special case when withdrawing all LP tokens from the pool (`lpTokensWithdraw == lptAMMBalance`), which empties the pool completely. For partial withdrawals, it calculates the pool fraction (`frac = tokensAdj / lptAMMBalance`), then multiplies each asset balance by this fraction, rounding down with [`getRoundedAsset`](helpers.md#23-getroundedasset) to ensure the pool retains sufficient assets.

**Example:**

A pool has 150 USD, 150 EUR, and 150 LP tokens outstanding. Bob holds 30 LP tokens (20% of the pool).

**Case 1: Bob redeems exactly 15 LP tokens (tfLPToken)**
- LP tokens to redeem: 15
- Fraction of pool: 15 / 150 = 0.1 (10%)
- USD withdrawn: 150 * 0.1 = 15 USD
- EUR withdrawn: 150 * 0.1 = 15 EUR
- Result: Bob redeems 15 LP tokens, receives 15 USD + 15 EUR
- Bob now holds: 15 LP tokens (10% of remaining pool)

**Case 2: Bob redeems all his LP tokens (tfWithdrawAll)**
- LP tokens to redeem: 30 (all Bob's holdings)
- Fraction of pool: 30 / 150 = 0.2 (20%)
- USD withdrawn: 150 * 0.2 = 30 USD
- EUR withdrawn: 150 * 0.2 = 30 EUR
- Result: Bob redeems 30 LP tokens, receives 30 USD + 30 EUR
- Bob now holds: 0 LP tokens

## 4.2. equalWithdrawLimit (tfTwoAsset)

> "I want to withdraw up to X and Y, how many LP tokens do I burn?"

The user specifies maximum amounts they want to withdraw for both assets (`Amount` and `Amount2`).[^equalWithdrawLimit] Since the withdrawal must maintain the pool's ratio, the function cannot simply use both maximum amounts - one will typically be limiting while the other has excess.

[^equalWithdrawLimit]: AMMWithdraw::equalWithdrawLimit: [AMMWithdraw.cpp](https://github.com/gregtatcam/rippled/blob/a72c3438eb0591a76ac829305fcbcd0ed3b8c325/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/AMMWithdraw.cpp#L915-L980)

The function tries two strategies to maximize the withdrawal within the user's constraints. First, it attempts to withdraw all of `Amount` by calculating the pool fraction this represents (`frac = Amount / amountBalance`), converting this to LP tokens with proper rounding, then recalculating the fraction from the rounded LP tokens (`frac = adjustFracByTokens(...)`) to ensure precision consistency. Using this adjusted fraction, it calculates the proportional amount2 needed. If this amount2 fits within `Amount2`, the withdrawal proceeds immediately.

Only if the first strategy fails does it try the second strategy: starting with all of `Amount2`, going through the same fraction -> LP tokens -> adjusted fraction → amount1 calculation. If the calculated amount1 exceeds `Amount`, the entire withdrawal fails.

**Example:**

There is an AMM with 100 USD and 100 EUR (1:1 ratio), 100 LP tokens outstanding. Bob holds 50 LP tokens and wants to make a proportional withdrawal.

**Case 1: Bob tries to withdraw up to 30 USD + 20 EUR**
- Strategy 1: Use all 30 USD and needs 30 EUR to maintain 1:1 ratio - FAILS (only wants 20 EUR)
- Strategy 2: Use all 20 EUR and needs 20 USD to maintain 1:1 ratio - SUCCESS (wants up to 30 USD)
- Result: Withdraws 20 USD + 20 EUR, redeems 20 LP tokens

**Case 2: Bob tries to withdraw up to 20 USD + 30 EUR**
- Strategy 1: Use all 20 USD and needs 20 EUR to maintain 1:1 ratio - SUCCESS (wants up to 30 EUR)
- Result: Withdraws 20 USD + 20 EUR, redeems 20 LP tokens

# 5. Single-Asset Withdrawal Modes

Single-asset withdrawal modes allow users to withdraw only one asset instead of both assets proportionally. Unlike [multi-asset withdrawals](#4-multi-asset-withdrawal-modes) that maintain the pool ratio, single-asset withdrawals change the pool composition. Because they alter the pool ratio, [trading fees](#3-gettradingfee) apply to single-asset withdrawals. There are three modes:

- **[singleWithdraw](#51-singlewithdraw-tfsingleasset) (tfSingleAsset)** - User specifies withdrawal amount, system calculates LP tokens to redeem
- **[singleWithdrawTokens](#52-singlewithdrawtokens-tfoneassetlptoken-tfoneassetwithdrawall) (tfOneAssetLPToken, tfOneAssetWithdrawAll)** - User specifies exact LP tokens to redeem or all LP tokens, withdraws calculated amount of single asset
- **[singleWithdrawEPrice](#53-singlewithdraweprice-tflimitlptoken) (tfLimitLPToken)** - User specifies minimum effective price limit

## 5.1. singleWithdraw (tfSingleAsset)

> "I want to withdraw X amount, how many LP tokens must I redeem?"

The user specifies `Amount` (the asset amount to withdraw) and the function calculates how many LP tokens must be redeemed.[^singleWithdraw] Since this is a single-asset withdrawal that changes the pool ratio, a [trading fee](#3-gettradingfee) applies. The function uses [`lpTokensIn`](helpers.md#331-lptokensin-equation-7) (Equation 7) to calculate the LP tokens based on the withdrawal amount and trading fee, then adjusts the result for precision with [`adjustLPTokensIn`](helpers.md#25-adjustlptokensin-withdrawals). The adjusted tokens are passed to `adjustAssetOutByTokens` to recalculate the withdrawal amount, ensuring the reverse calculation produces consistent results and doesn't underpay the user due to rounding.

Withdraw a single asset by redeeming specified LP tokens.[^singleWithdrawTokens]

This function handles the reverse calculation from [`singleWithdraw`](#51-singlewithdraw-tfsingleasset): the user specifies the exact number of LP tokens to redeem (using `LPTokenIn` for tfOneAssetLPToken, or all LP tokens for tfOneAssetWithdrawAll), and the function calculates the withdrawal amount of a single asset. The user can provide `Amount` as a minimum constraint on how much they expect to receive.

The function first adjusts the LP tokens for precision using [`adjustLPTokensIn`](helpers.md#25-adjustlptokensin-withdrawals), then uses [`ammAssetOut`](helpers.md#332-ammassetout-equation-8) (Equation 8) to calculate the withdrawal amount by solving the inverse single-asset withdrawal problem. If the calculated amount is less than the user's `Amount` constraint (when non-zero), the transaction fails with `tecAMM_FAILED`.

## 5.3. singleWithdrawEPrice (tfLimitLPToken)

> "I'll withdraw (single asset), but only if the effective price per LP token is reasonable."

Withdraw a single asset with an effective price constraint.

This mode allows users to control the effective price when redeeming LP tokens, where effective price is defined as the ratio of LP tokens redeemed to asset withdrawn. The user provides `EPrice` (minimum effective price) and optionally `Amount` (minimum withdrawal amount). Unlike deposits where users set a maximum effective price (to avoid overpaying), withdrawals use a minimum effective price constraint - a lower effective price means a better deal for the withdrawer (fewer LP tokens per asset withdrawn).

The function solves a derived formula from Equation 8 to calculate the LP tokens that achieve exactly the specified effective price. It then calculates the withdrawal amount as `tokensAdj * ePrice`. If the calculated amount is less than the user's optional `Amount` constraint, the transaction fails with `tecAMM_FAILED`.

# 6. Common Withdraw Function

The `withdraw()` function[^withdraw] serves as the final common pathway for all withdrawal modes, executing the actual asset transfers after mode-specific handlers determine the withdrawal amounts.

[^withdraw]: AMMWithdraw::withdraw: [AMMWithdraw.cpp](https://github.com/gregtatcam/rippled/blob/a72c3438eb0591a76ac829305fcbcd0ed3b8c325/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/AMMWithdraw.cpp#L471-L722)

This function orchestrates a sequenced validation and execution flow. It begins by verifying the withdrawer holds sufficient LP tokens to redeem, then enforces pool integrity constraints that prevent malformed states. 

The function prohibits one-sided pool withdrawals - situations where all of one asset would be withdrawn while the other remains. When a withdrawal would redeem all outstanding LP tokens, the function mandates that all pool assets must also be withdrawn, preventing orphaned assets in an empty pool.

Before executing transfers, the function checks whether the withdrawer has adequate XRP reserves if new trust lines or MPTokens need creation. For MPTs, this includes verifying proper authorization from the issuer. The function then transfers each withdrawn asset from the AMM account to the withdrawer, waiving transfer fees as AMM operations are privileged. Finally, it burns the redeemed LP tokens by calling `redeemIOU`, which reduces both the withdrawer's LP token balance and the total outstanding token supply.
